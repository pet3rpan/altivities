# Clock

## Play

You should be able to see the clock at <https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/clock/>

## About

This is a simple "game" that you can use with your class to practice telling time.

The clock will randomly move to a position. Please enter the time that it shows.

You must enter all digits in the minutes, for example `5:5` and `05:5` are incorrect, but `5:05` and `05:05` are both OK.

## Settings

If you click the gear in the top left of the screen, you can adjust the randomness of the clock to only generate certain times.
