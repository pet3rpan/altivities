# Let's Play Bingo

## About

This is a simple 3x3 bingo card generator that you can use on a tablet (e.g. iPad) to play bingo.

When you load a wordlist, if you click on the `QR` button, you can have the students scan the QR code to make their own bingo sheet.

Students can drag the tiles from the right on to the bingo grid, or click the 'Random' button to automatically generate a card.

## Wordlists

## 4x4 and 5x5 cards

For 4x4 cards, add `&4x4=1` to the end of the URL, for example: `https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/alphabet.json&4x4=1`.

For 5x5 cards, add `&5x5=1` to the end of the URL, for example: `https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/alphabet.json&5x5=1`.

Note, that you won't be able to hit the `ready` button if you don't have enough cards to fill in the card. You *could* get creative and use the same wordlist twice, to allow duplicates, for example: `https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlists=../wordlists/General/numbers.json,../wordlists/General/numbers.json&5x5=1`. Note that the `numbers.json` is used twice.

## Custom Wordlists

Please see the [wordlist documentation](../wordlists/) to see how to make your own wordlist.

After uploading your wordlist to the web, change the path to the wordlist in the URL: `https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlist=<path-to-url-here>`

## Multiple Wordlists

Use the following URL pattern to combine multiple wordlists:
`https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlists=<path-to-url-1-here>,<path-to-url-2-here>,<...>`

## Ignoring (Excluding) Words

You can ignore words from your wordlist(s) by adding `&ignore=<word 1>,<word 2>,<...>` to the URL.

Example: <https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/numbers.json&ignore=one,three,five>

## Filtering (Including) Words

**NOTE**: This is not for including *extra* words. To do that, you need to add an additional wordlist, or modify the wordlist to include more words.

**NOTE**: You need a minimum of nine words to play bingo, so the URL can get quite long.

You can specify the set of words you want to use by adding `&include=<word 1>,<word 2>,<...>` to the URL.

Example: <https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/bingo/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/numbers.json&include=ten,eleven,twelve,thirteen,fourteen,fifteen,sixteen,seventeen,eighteen,nineteen,twenty>
