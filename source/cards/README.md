## Custom Wordlists

Please see the [wordlist documentation](../wordlists/) to see how to make your own wordlist.

After uploading your wordlist to the web, change the path to the wordlist in the URL: `https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/cards/?wordlist=<path-to-url-here>`

## Multiple Wordlists

Use the following URL pattern to combine multiple wordlists:
`https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/cards/?wordlists=<path-to-url-1-here>,<path-to-url-2-here>,<...>`

## Ignoring (Excluding) Words

You can ignore words from your wordlist(s) by adding `&ignore=<word 1>,<word 2>,<...>` to the URL.

Example: <https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/cards/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/numbers.json&ignore=one,three,five>

## Filtering (Including) Words

**NOTE**: This is not for including *extra* words. To do that, you need to add an additional wordlist, or modify the wordlist to include more words.

You can specify the set of words you want to use by adding `&include=<word 1>,<word 2>,<...>` to the URL.

Example: <https://altivities.earthiverse.ca/cards/?wordlist=../wordlists/General/numbers.json&include=ten,eleven,twelve,thirteen,fourteen,fifteen,sixteen,seventeen,eighteen,nineteen,twenty>
